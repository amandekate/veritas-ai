🕵️‍♀️ Veritas AI — Multimodal Fake News Detection

A multimodal fake news detection system that analyzes textual headlines and associated images to classify news as Real or Fake.
The system combines predictions from a text model (BERT) and an image model (ResNet50) using late fusion with configurable weights.

🎯 Why it matters: Fake news often appears credible in one modality (text or image). This system explicitly handles that weakness.

📌 Project Overview

Fake news often exploits both misleading text and deceptive images. Single-modal systems fail when one modality appears legitimate.

This project addresses that gap by:

Analyzing headline text using a transformer-based NLP model

Analyzing news images using a CNN-based vision model

Combining predictions using late fusion

Allowing dynamic control of modality importance via UI

🧠 Architecture
Text Modality

Model: BERT (fine-tuned)

Input: News headline

Output: Probability of REAL news

Image Modality

Model: ResNet50 (fine-tuned)

Input: News image

Output: Probability of REAL news

Fusion Strategy

Late Fusion (Weighted Average)

Final score:
w_text × P_text(real) + w_image × P_image(real)

Weights always sum to 1.0 and are adjustable in real time

🖥️ Application Interface

The system is deployed as a Streamlit web application with:

Text input for news headline

Image upload for related news image

Slider to control text vs image importance

Clear verdict display: REAL or FAKE

Confidence score with per-modality breakdown

## 🔗 Pretrained Models

Due to GitHub file size limitations, the pretrained models used in this project are hosted on Google Drive.

### Contents
- **final_text_model.h5** — Fine-tuned BERT text model
- **final_image_model.keras** — Fine-tuned ResNet50 image model

After downloading, place both files in the project root directory before running the Streamlit app.

📊 Output Explanation

Final Verdict: REAL or FAKE

Confidence Score: Probability of the predicted class

BERT Score: Contribution from text modality

ResNet Score: Contribution from image modality

This breakdown ensures interpretability, not just blind prediction.

🚫 Limitations

Being transparent:

No cross-modal attention (modalities processed independently)

Performance depends on dataset quality

Only headline text is used (not full articles)

Fusion weights are manually controlled, not learned

These constraints are intentional and clearly scoped.

🚀 Future Improvements

Learned fusion instead of manual weights

Cross-modal attention mechanisms

Full article text analysis

Explainability using Grad-CAM and attention visualization

Real-time news scraping integration
